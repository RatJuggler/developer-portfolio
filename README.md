# developer-portfolio

My developer portfolio website.

Rather than copying a random template off the internet I'm trying to create something a bit different from scratch (or at least 
only adapting random bits off the internet that I can understand and modify, like all good projects do ðŸ˜„).

The idea is to build a number of different versions of the same site:

1. Using static pages only to act as an outline of the design. 
2. Breaking down the static pages and using a templating engine with data files to generate the content.
3. Building some sort of back end to serve the data and using that from a further evolved set of templates.
4. Expanding the back end and building a front end using a web component framework.

I've completed some outline designs, which you can see [here](https://ratjuggler.github.io/developer-portfolio/), and started 
building the template version.

Content for the site will include:

- About - Short introductory paragraph about myself.
- Skills - Table highlighting my hard & soft skills with option to sort, filter and mark items.
- Career - Rough timeline from when I started with the dinosaurs to the present day space age.
- Interests - Brief details on my outside interests.

- Table - Uses the Bootstrap table extension [from here](https://bootstrap-table.com/).

Where the use is "based" on I have taken the initial code and rewritten it, removing any jQuery and adding my own tweaks.
