# developer-portfolio
My developer portfolio website.

Rather than copying a random template off the internet I'm trying to create something a bit different from scratch (or at least 
only adapting random bits off the internet that I can understand and modify, like all good projects do ðŸ˜„).

The idea is to build a number of different versions of the same site:

1. Using static pages only to act as an outline of the design. 
2. Breaking down the static pages and using a templating engine to serve the markup and content.
3. Building some sort of back end to serve the content and using that from a further evolved set of templates.
4. Expanding the back end and building a front end using a web component framework.

Version one is under construction.

Content for the site will include:

- About - Short introductory paragraph about myself.
- Skills - Table highlighting my hard & soft skills with option to sort, filter and mark items.
- Career - Rough timeline showing from when I started with the dinosaurs to the present day space age.
- Interests - Card/photo carousel
